## Predictive analysis projects includes- <br/>
* <b>COVID19 prediction in India using ARIMA model-</b>
     - The goal of this [project](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20analysis%20projects/Project%20COVID19%20prediction%20ARIMA.ipynb) is to forecast the number og confirmed cases in India for next 30 days so that government can take major preventive measures in                         order to reduce the predicted counts.
     - You can find the full project report [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4kNTCJh9OTVS4lPbJEt5s262uGLRPLD/view?usp=sharing)

* <b>COVID19 prediction using LSTM-</b>
     - Before doing this project using ARIMA, I have tried the same project using LSTM but since the data was less it didn't gave accurate results. So, I tried the same               usecase using ARIMA model and it gave me more accurate results. Find it [here.](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20analysis%20projects/COVID19%20predictions%20using%20LSTM.ipynb)
     - You can find the brief project synopsis [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zEjAUOccMnfSNSEpS3akglY95FdGhP-D/view?usp=sharing)
* <b>Anomaly Detection in S&P data-</b>
     - It uses [S&P 500 Data](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20analysis%20projects/S%26P_500_Index_Data.csv)
     - This [project](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20analysis%20projects/Anomaly%20detection%20with%20Keras.ipynb) involves detecting anomalies in our time series data which often affect in the preformance of our model.
* <b>SuperMarketSales Forecasting-</b>
     - This project involves forecasting sales of a Supermarket (original dataset given [here.](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/EDA%20projects/SuperMarketSales%20EDA/train.csv)) I preprocessed the data in the EDA notebook of the same project [here.](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/EDA%20projects/SuperMarketSales%20EDA/EDA.ipynb)
     - The preprocessed data used here for forecasting is found [here.](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20analysis%20projects/SuperMarketSales%20Forecasting/preprocessed_train.csv)
     - Time Series Forecasting is done using ARIMA model, find [here.](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20analysis%20projects/SuperMarketSales%20Forecasting/Forecasting_model_training.ipynb)
