Predictive analysis projects includes-
1. Time series prediction of COVID19 using LSTM
2. COVID19 prediction in India for 30 days using ARIMA
2. Anomaly Detection in S&P data

## COVID19 prediction in India using ARIMA model
#### Objective- The goal of this project is to forecast the number og confirmed cases in India for next 30 days so that government can take major preventive measures in order to reduce the predicted counts.

## COVID19 prediction using LSTM
#### Before doing this project using ARIMA, I have tried the same project using LSTM but since the data was less it didn't gave accurate results. So, I tried the same usecase using ARIMA model and it gave me more accurate results.
